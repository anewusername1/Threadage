Warning!! As of right now (7/31/10) this library is only partially tested. Working on getting it completely tested and hopefully will achieve that within the week.

This library is for managing threads. Use it like so

require './threadage'
tm = Threadage.new(5)
tm.start do
  puts "verking #{Thread.current}"
  sleep rand(5)
end

It will continually execute the block passed to it.
If you want control of the program back, you should start it within a thread
Thread.new do
  tm.start do
    ...
  end
end

That way you can continue doing things.

You also have the ability to specify a block to run before creating a thread and one to run after the thread has executed the block. Like so:

tm = Threadage.new(5)
tm.afore_thread do
  ...
end

tm.aft_thread do
  ...
end
_

You also have the option of dynamically specifying how many threads should run based on a number such as how many jobs are backed up in a queue, like so:
Thread.new do
  tm.start do
    tm.max_threads = (Math.log(num_jobs * 3))
    ...
  end
end

Feel free to contact if you have any questions or issues
